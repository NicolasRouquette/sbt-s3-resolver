In this version we migrated from weird `spring-aws-ivy` to @evdokim's brand new `ivy-s3-resolver`, and got rid of strange dependencies!

Usage changes:
* no more `pattern` and `s3resolver` setting keys
* for creating a resolver use `s3resolver` _function_
* it requires credentials and returns Resolver (without Option)

For more details see Readme.
